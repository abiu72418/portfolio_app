# portfolio_app

Build a single-page personal portfolio website with sections for 'About Me', 'Projects', and 'Contact'. The page must also include a toggle button that switches the website between a light theme and a dark theme. Use CSS variables to manage the color themes. Create separate files for index.html, style.css, and script.js
